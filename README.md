obligatory intro post ^^

star ⋆ he/they ⋆ 19 ( 07 / 30 )  ⋆ taken

tmasc nonbinary ⋆ diagnosed gad and depression ⋆ undiagnosed autism ( we're pretty sure )

i'm star !  my close friends may call me jay, as it is my actual name, but if we don't know each other super well, i would prefer to be called star .  c + h is okay, i don't bite !! whisper if i don't respond, i might be offtab ...

 i block/hide freely, but never without reason !!
 
if you like my skins, feel free to ask me about how i designed certain parts of them ! as long as you ask first, i do not mind you trying to recreate. please don't copy *everything* though, i did work very hard on a lot of my ponies .

p.s. always open to music recommendations .
